Following the design bestow, the following chapter aims at presenting possible scenarios in which the realized system, with its integrated and interconnected visualizations, might aid different kinds of users.
We analyze the use of the interface both through the lens of a professor explaining how eXplainability methods work or a student who is approaching the subject of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence for the first time -- but has some previous knowledge regarding common techniques, such as commonly used datasets, commonly used classifiers, and dimensionality reduction techniques -- both through the lens of a more experienced data scientist or someone with deeper field knowledge that could use the system to analyze it's own classifier reliability and explore how the chosen eXplainability method ($\text{LORE}_{sa}$) explains the model.

Through those very distant lenses, we aim to provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding of how the system can be interacted with and how the users who might fall in between the two exposed cases might interact with the system.

implemented:
* plot for big decision trees
* zoom in/out 
* tooltip to show split and leaf informations on node hover
* drag to move around the plot
* click on leaf node to highlight splits path to reach it
* inverse node search by number input box (for future synchronization with other plot)

to implement:
* integration in lore workflow
* instance reconstruction on leaf nodes
